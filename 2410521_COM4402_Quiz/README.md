## Project Description

This is a simple multiple-choice quiz program written in Python.  
The program shows one question at a time with four options, and the user types the number of the answer.  
The program checks if the answer is correct and keeps track of the score until the end of the quiz.

This project is part of my learning, and I am using it to practise functions, loops, lists, and input validation.
